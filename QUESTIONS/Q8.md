### Interfaces in Typescript

Interfaces define the shape objects must have. We donâ€™t control access to the properties of an interface nor do we implement its functions.

Ex.
```javascript
interface CarDoor {
  color: string;
  position: number;
}
 
function logCarDoorColor(carDoor: CarDoor) {
  console.log('The color of the door is: ' + carDoor.color);
}
 
let myDoor: CarDoor;
myDoor.color = 'red';
myDoor.position = 0;
logCarDoorColor(myDoor);
```
In the example, we define an interface `CarDoor` with two properties. We use the interface to ensure calls to logCarDoorColor receive a parameter of shape `CarDoor`. When we create the object, `myDoor`, we successfully call `logCarDoorColor` because it has a color property of type `string` and a position property of type `number`, thus, the object conforms to the shape of the `CarDoor` interface.

##### Optional parameters
Interfaces with optional properties are written similar to other interfaces, with each optional property denoted by a `?` at the end of the property name in the declaration.
```javascript
interface SquareConfig {
    color?: string;
    width?: number;
}
```

#### Implementing an interface

```javascript
interface ClockInterface {
    currentTime: Date;
}

class Clock implements ClockInterface {
    currentTime: Date;
    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }
}
```
#### Extending Interfaces
Like classes, interfaces can extend each other. An interface can extend multiple interfaces, creating a combination of all of the interfaces.
```javascript
interface Shape {
    color: string;
}

interface Square extends Shape {
    sideLength: number;
}

let square = <Square>{};
square.color = "blue";
square.sideLength = 10;
```

#### Difference between interface and inheritence
Inheritance in simple terms is to acquire the properties / behaviours of an other class.
Interface is a Type Definition Block.
