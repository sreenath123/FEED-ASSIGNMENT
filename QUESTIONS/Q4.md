### Map, Filter and Reduce

When to use:

 *   If I have an array and I want to do the exact same operation on each of the elements in the array and return the same amount of items in the array, use the `map`.
  *  If I have an array but Ionly want to have items in the array that match certain criteria, use the `filter`.
   * If I have an array, but I want to use the values in that array to create something completely new, use the `reduce`.

Example:
```javscript
const animals = [
    {
        "name": "cat",
        "size": "small",
        "weight": 5
    },
    {
        "name": "dog",
        "size": "small",
        "weight": 10
    },
    {
        "name": "lion",
        "size": "medium",
        "weight": 150
    },
    {
        "name": "elephant",
        "size": "big",
        "weight": 5000
    }
]
```

#### The `map` operator:

Let’s say we want to have an array with just the names of all the animals. 

ES5 (using `for-loop`) way:

```javascript
let animal_names = [];

for (let i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
    animal_names.push(animals[i].name);
}
```

ES6 way (using `map`)
```javascript
let animal_names = animals.map((animal, index, animals) => {
    return animal.name
})
```

#### The `filter` operator:
Let’s say that we want array of only the animals which are small.

ES5 way:
```javascript
let small_animals = [];

for (let i = 0; i < animals.length; i ++) {
    if (animals[i].size === "small") {
        small_animals.push(animals[i])
    }
}
```
ES6 way:
```javascript
let small_animals = animals.filter((animal) => {
    return animal.size === "small"
})
```
#### The `reduce` operator:
Let’s say that we want to calculate the combined weight of all the animals in our array.

ES5 way:
```javascript
let total_weight = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
    total_weigth += animals[i].weight
}
```
ES6 way:
```javascript
let total_weight = animals.reduce((weight, animal, index, animals) => {
    return weight += animal.weight
}, 0)
```
 * The first parameter is the current value of the end value. We have to set the initial value at the end of the function. In this case we set it as 0.
 * The second parameter is the current item in the array.
 * The third is the index again.
 * The last is the full array.
